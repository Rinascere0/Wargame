"""
Hi there, this is Hu Jian from CASIA. I am excited to release this module under
open source license. It contains some basic but really useful functions for
developing your own agent.
The implementation of path finding in the module is inspired by this awesome
blog which I strongly recommend you to take a look at.
  https://www.redblobgames.com/pathfinding/a-star/introduction.html
Feel free to add or modify anything you want.
Have fun!

NOTE: After this release, the use of `core.utils` is discouraged and will be
deprecated. To migrate your code, just change every appearance of
`from core.utils.map import Map`
inside you agent module to
`from .map import Map`.

P.S. If you dislike these lengthy comments as much as I do, delete them.
That's fine. :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:

        `self.see[mode]` is a `numpy.ndarray` that supports multidimensional

        `self.see[mode][row, col]`.

        By bit-masking see matrices of different positions, you could easily get
        all desired positions. For example,
        `np.argwhere((self.see[0][8, 24] & self.see[0][24, 8]) == True)` returns
        all positions that can be seen from both `0824` and `2408`. Tweak the
        condition and you could create a lot more interesting stuff.

        Generate one of the fastest move path from `begin` to `end` with given
        `mode` using A* algorithm.

        Here I use python standard `heapq` package just for convenience. The
        idea of A* search algorithm is quite simple. It combines BFS with
        priority queue and adds some heuristic to accelerate the search.

        When an obstacle appears, you could modify the corresponding
        `self.cost[mode][row][col]` to some big number. Then this function is
        still able to give you one of the fastest path available.

        As you might have thought, it's ok to inject even more insights to the
        so-called `cost`. For example, when feeling a "threat", you could
        increase cost or add heuristic at some positions to avoid passing
        through these "dangerous" regions.

        For those who want to find all positions that can be reached within a
        given amount of time, Dijkstra is all you need. It's only BFS with
        priority queue. To find all positions that can be reached within a given
        amount of time, just modify the exit condition inside `search()` and
        save all valid positions during search. It's left for you brilliant
        developers to implement.
